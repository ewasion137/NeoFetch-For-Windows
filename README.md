# I made a GNU Linux NeoFetch (or FastFetch) inside Windows
*Made on batch*

- I got ASCII art of Windows from here: https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch/issues/1466

If you want to put the file inside C:\Windows or inside PATH (to run it from CMD), run Installer.bat.

If you want to UNINSTALL it from Windows folder and PATH, run Uninstaller.bat.
